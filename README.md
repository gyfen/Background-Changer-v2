# Background Changer v2
This is a better background changer than the one I made with a batch file. This is made using AutoHotkey.

## Instructions
1. Run the ahk file or the exe. Run the exe file if you don't have AutoHotkey installed. You can delete the one you don't use.
2. Select and open your image you'd like to have as a background.
